								<div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
									<p>When approaching complex operational or organizational transformation projects, we take a human-centred approach. We use behavioural and process research to understand and map the larger picture. Our discovery phase focuses on understanding how your users are impacted by your services, products and organizational behaviors. </p>
								</div>
								<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">
									<p>We also interview and analyse internal staﬀ, processes, systems and the physical spaces that people work in to understand how these are affecting performance both within the organization and externally with customers or users. The design and delivery phases focus on identifying and creating new processes, organizational designs, policies and tools. We use an iterative approach to measuring the impact and effectiveness of these improvements across a set of financial, structural and experiential criteria that are relevant to our clients’ business outcomes.</p>

										<h2>Product Innovation</h2>
									</header>
								</div>
								<div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
									<p>The challenge with many innovation and product development initiatives is that they are often technology led programmes of work, which are retroﬁtted to meet assumed customer needs. We believe that change begins with people, and understanding how they behave, interact and work. Technology should underpin the core capabilities of your organisation, not dictate them, and Hominal use their experience of working in real-world programme delivery environments to ensure tangible results are delivered.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">
									<p>Our unique iterative service design approach runs alongside and ahead of a Lean or Agile UX and development process to constantly identify and reﬁne changing customer needs. We then work hand in hand with internal or supplier teams to ensure that each iteration or phase of new products continue to meet business and customer requirements and deliver real value at launch and long into the future.</p>

									<p>We use primary research to understand what customers, citizens, staﬀ and others actually do, think, feel, need and experience. Our research methods are often intensive and rigorously documented. We are often run collaborative sessions with members of the client’s organisation to aggregate internal knowledge.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="6u$ 12u$(xsmall)">
									<span class="fit"><img src="content/icons/define.png" alt="Discover" /></span>
									<p>Research is analysed and turned into ease to understand artefacts such as journey maps, which illustrate what people actually do and how it aﬀects the overall experience. The deﬁne stage is useful for understanding people’s requirements and real issues, and for spotting initial opportunities.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="6u 12u$(xsmall)">
									<span class="fit"><img src="content/icons/design.png" alt="Discover" /></span>
									<p>Solutions are then deﬁned, often collaboratively with our clients and customers and brought to life in blueprints, storyboards, future state journeys and other artefacts.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="6u$ 12u$(xsmall)">
									<span class="fit"><img src="content/icons/deliver.png" alt="Discover" /></span>
									<p>The delivery phase can be a single output to an iterative, <em>‘test – learn – reﬁne – launch – iterate’</em> process that can continue and deliver improvement through the life of the product or service. Outputs can range anything from new processes and staﬀ policies, to digital, service and spatial prototypes, which we then test and implement.</p>
