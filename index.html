								<div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
									<p>When approaching complex operational or organizational transformation projects, we take a

human-centred approach. We use behavioural and process research to understand and map

the larger picture. Our discovery phase focuses on understanding how your users are impacted

by your services, products and organizational behaviours. </p>
								</div>
								<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">
									<p>We also interview and analyse internal staff, processes, systems and the physical spaces that

people work in in order to understand how these affect performance both within the organization

and externally with customers or users. The design and delivery phases focus on identifying and

creating new processes, organizational designs, policies and tools. We use an iterative

approach to measure the impact and effectiveness of these improvements across a set of

financial, structural and experiential criteria that are relevant to our clients’ specific business

outcomes.</p>

										<h2>Product Innovation</h2>
									</header>
								</div>
								<div class="6u 12u$(medium)">
									<p>The challenge with many innovation and product development initiatives is that they are often

technology-led programmes of work, which are retroﬁtted to meet assumed customer needs.

We believe that change begins with people and with understanding how they behave, interact

and work. Technology should enable and mobilize the core capabilities of your organisation, not

define them, and Hominal use their experience of working in real-world programme delivery

environments to ensure tangible results are delivered.</p>
								</div>
								<div class="6u$ 12u$(medium)">
									<p>Our unique iterative service design approach runs alongside and ahead of a Lean or Agile UX

and development process to constantly identify and reﬁne changing customer needs. We then

work hand-in-hand with internal or supplier teams to ensure that each iteration or phase of new

products continue to meet business and customer requirements and to deliver real value both at

launch and long into the future.</p>

								<section class="6u 12u$(xsmall)">
									<span class="fit"><img src="content/icons/discover.png" alt="Discover" /></span>
									<p>We use primary research to understand what customers, citizens, staff and others actually do,

think, feel, need and experience. Our research methods are often intensive and rigorously

documented. We often run collaborative sessions with members of the client’s organisation to

aggregate internal knowledge.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="6u$ 12u$(xsmall)">
									<span class="fit"><img src="content/icons/define.png" alt="Discover" /></span>
									<p>Research is analysed and turned into easy-to-understand artefacts, such as journey maps,

which illustrate what people actually do and how it affects the overall experience. The deﬁne

stage is useful for understanding people’s requirements and real issues, and for spotting initial

opportunities for immediate impact as well as longer-term transformation.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="6u 12u$(xsmall)">
									<span class="fit"><img src="content/icons/design.png" alt="Discover" /></span>
									<p>Solutions are then deﬁned, often collaboratively with our clients and customers, and brought to

life in blueprints, storyboards, future state journeys and other artefacts. These solutions are then

rigorously tested in various prototype stages to ensure we understand the most appropriate way

to implement them at scale.</p>
								</section>
								<section class="6u$ 12u$(xsmall)">
									<span class="fit"><img src="content/icons/deliver.png" alt="Discover" /></span>
									<p>The delivery phase can be a single output to an agile, <em>‘test > learn > reﬁne > launch > iterate’</em>

process that can continue and deliver improvement through the life of the product or service.

Outputs can range from new processes and staff policies, to digital, service and spatial

prototypes, which we then partner with you to test and implement.</p>
